How to create user in Oracle Applications?

NB: Deployment of report is done in Oracle Applications and Report publishing is done in BI Publisher.

Different types of executable in Oracle Apps :
Java concurrent program
Multi - language function
Oracle reports
PL/SQl Stored procedure
Sql Loader
Sql Plus
Host
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Differnt types of reports in Oracle Applications : 3 types
Oracle Reports
XML Publisher
BI Publisher
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Creating Oracle reports 
1.Create menu and custom reponsibility
2.create Executable (Executable name , Application name , Executable method,File name
3.Create concurrent programs (attach executable file and parameters)
4.Create request group and attach Program name
5.create responsibility (request group + data group +menu)
6.create user and attach reponsibility
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Define executable , concurrent program , request group , responsibility ,menu ,profile option :

what is executable ?
its an object type which needs to get executed at the backend when the concurrent program 
runs in Oracle Apps.

What is concurrent program?
Instance of Execution file along with parameters .

What is request group ?
A request security group is the collection of requests, 
request sets, and 
concurrent programs that a user is operating under a given responsibility.

What is A responsibility ?
A responsibility is a level of authority in Oracle Applications that lets you access only those 
Oracle Applications functions and data appropriate to fulfill your role in an organization.
Each user has at least one responsibility and multiple users can use same responsibility .

What is menu?
Menu is a list of the functions and submenus that are attached to a responsibility. 

what is a form ?
Form is a java plugin/user interface to insert/update/delete data into and from database.
Application developer registers form function while developing forms

Every responsibility will have a menu attached to it.

What is a profile option in Oracle Apps ?

In Oracle Apps, a profile option is a configurable setting that tells how the application behaves. 
2 types of profile option.
System profile options : it is set by the system administrator and not accessed by the regular user.
User profile options:
Four level of hierarchy in this level (SARU)
Site (bigger range) , Application level , Responsibility level , User level(smaller range)


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.ERP business areas : 
Product planning , Sales , Marketing , Finance,Human resources , Procurement

2.Functional Gaps : Difference b/w business requirements and Original ERP System is called Functional Gaps.

3.End user of Erp System :
Business users 
Management/executives

4.TCO: Total Cost Ownership.
TCO = Starting cost + Operational cost
Starting cost = Implementation + software + hardware
Operational Cost = support and maintainence , bugs fixing, data backup and recovery.

5.Customizations : Technical consultant modify the Functional gaps by adding new functionality to the Original ERP system , this step is called Customizations.
New reports are craeted in this step.

6.Interfaces: In Oracle Apps Interfaces are generally tables, which act as a medium to transfer the data from one module to another module or to transfer the data from legacy system into Oracle Applications. 
There are 352 tables provided by the Oracle Package. Each module has its own Interface Tables.

7.Migration : 3 sets of environment in ERP System ( Development + Testing + Production)
Copying of configuration from one environment to another is called Migration.
[ Migration = Transporting setup ]
Developemt ----> Testing ----> Production

data conversion

8.What is Valueset ?
-> A valueset is a list of values with validation that is used to restrict the user without entering the invalid in the parameter.
A valueset is used in Concurrent program parameters , while defining flexfields.

What are the different types of valuesets?

Types of valuesets :
1.Independent
2.Dependent
3.Subset
4.Table
5.Pair


9.what is lookups ? with example.
Lookups are the list of values in Oracle applications.
Lookup types contains a set of lookup codes, each code's translated meaning.
Example :
Lookup type :Role_Cognizant

LookupCode 		Meaning
PA 			Programmer Analyst
PAT 			Programmer Analyst Trainee
GENC 			Generation in Cognizant
M			Manager

Lookup types:
Standard lookup- Simplest form of lookup types with a lookup code with their meaning.
Common lookup
Set enabled lookup

Why lookups?
to provide validation or a list of values for a user input field in a user interface.

What is flexfields?
A flexfields is made of sub-fields and segments. 
Types of flexfields are key flexfields and descriptive flexfields.

Key flexfields :
Key flexfields - KFF are the unique identifiers or contraints in EBS.KFF created meaningful codes fo various entities like Serial no of a product.
Mandatory business information, stored in segments and displays like text item.
Example :
Oragnisation ABC is using a  Notebook Coded as HP_BW_14(meaning HP Notebook ,Color - Black and White , 14")
Another organisation is using same notebook coded as HP_Notebook_14_BW

Descriptive flexfields:
DFF - Additional business information , stored in attributes , optional , diplays like [].
Example:
Suppose you’re entering employee details, 
and you want to capture additional information like certifications, skills, or location, salary.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What is XML Publsiher?

Properties:
Pure Java
Pluggable data in XML
Output format - PDF,XML,RTF,HTML
Support for printing protocol
Applications : MS Word , MS Excel ,Adobe Acrobat


-> (BI Publisher)
   -> It is also called Template Builder reports .
template based publishing solution delivered with the Oracle ebuisness suite
approach to design reports and publishing .
custom templates with the concurrent request request data to generate output
in Excel ,PDF, Chart format

DAta logic/model + layout + translation  ----> reports output

why XML Publsiher?
-> 
Oracle reports output in different languages , 
reports in chart format, 
report output in excel
publishing the output in intranet/interet
eliminating some columns from the reports.


How to create XML publisher Report (with parameter) in Oracle apps R12 using data template Approach :

Using PL-SQL and Report builder
Steps (Using PL-SQL)
1.Creating the data template.
2.Go to the XML Publisher , go to data definition and attach data template in .xml format.
3.executable  (XDODTEXE)

	NB: XDODTEXE is java concurrent program used as a BI Publisher Data template Executable.
4.create concurrent program attaching the parameters and add valuesets and output format in XML.
5.attach this concurrent program in request group ( Application Developer reports) .
6.run this program creating a new request and get the output (XML File)
7.using xml file creating rtf template and attach in template section (XML Publishers)
8.run this program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.What is Oracle Workflow?
Oracle workflow -> workflow management system .
A workflow process consists of a sequence of activities that together make up a business flow, expressing your organization’s policies and rules. 
The activities can include automated functions, notifications to users, sub processes and business events.

example - 1. validate self-service transactions .
	    2.automatically delivery notifications and notify when the work is done.

2.calendar
3.currency



Q.What is interface ?
Communication between Original erp system and third party app (vendors/suppliers) is called interface.

Q.refresh/cloning :
copying of data from production environment to testing/ development environment is called refresh/cloning.

Q.seeded api :
Define: Seeded APIs are predefined interfaces provided by Oracle.
Purpose: They allow developers to interact with Oracle Applications programmatically.
Example: The fnd_user_pkg API includes a procedure called createuser, which is used to create a user login account.


Q.what is api ?
API - Application programming interface. It defines a set of rules and protocols for interaction.
Examples of Api in oracle apps
FND_PROGRAM.EXECUTABLE
FND_PROGRAM.REGISTER
FND_PROGRAM.PARAMETER
FND_PROGRAM.ADD_TO_GROUP
FND_REQUEST.SUBMIT_REQUEST

-> $flex $value set name.


Q.Requisition types
Internal requsition:  example - no external resources
Purchasing requsition: example - vendors/suppliers involved

 
Q.Difference between apps and customs schema.
Apps Schema : The APPS schema is a special schema within EBS. 
It primarily consists of synonyms and does not allow the creation of tables directly within it.

Custom schema : Custom schemas are user-defined schemas that can contain tables and other objects.
Unlike the APPS schema, custom schemas allow the creation of tables.


Q.Which are the kinds of report triggers?
There are mainly five different kinds of report triggers available. They are:

Before report
After report
Before parameter form
After parameter form
Between pages


Q.What is rdf ?
rdf - resource description framework.
Oracle reports extension file name is rdf.

Q.mandatory parameters in package .
2 parameters(retcode, errbuff)
retcode :{0,1,2} -> 0 - successfully run/compiled , 1 - warning , 2- error
errbuff:to show error message in program and send the message in log file

Q.token in concurrent program
Token links to the parameter , transfer values towards reports builder , it is case-sensitive .

Q.SQL loader - loads external files towards the oracle database.
client send raw data.


Q.difference between schema and databases
Schema : A schema is a logical definition of a database .It includes information about tables , columns and relationships among the tables.
A schema is defined using DDL.

Databases :
Databases means collection of related data .
databases is dynamic as records is updated,inserted and delted.
Database contains schema , records and constraints .
Operations are performed using DML .



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q.Explain the P2P process flow?
P2P Cycle:


Steps -
1.Creation of requisition : this is the first step in P2P(proceure to pay) cycle. the requisition is made by the inventory department to the purchasing dept 
of company .now this requisition includes necessarry info about the product, description, price , quantity.

tables - PO_requisition_headers_All
	   PO_requisition_lines_All
	   PO_req_distribution_All

2.RFQ : 2nd step in p2p cycle . here purchaseing dept request for quotattion or RFQ 
to different suppliers/vendors mentioning buyers price, product details,price.

3.Quotation : 3rd step in p2p cycle, here different suppliers send quotation to the purchasing department mentioning the deals they can give.
4.PO Creation : supose supplier - 1 is giving the best deals , so purchasing dept created a new purchase order (PO) to the supplier - 1.
PO tables : PO_headers_All
		PO_lines_All
		po_distribution_All

5.Receiveing items  : after getting the purchasing order details , supplier sends the goods/items to the inventory .
tables : rcv_shipments_headers
	   rvc_shipments_lines

	
6. creation OF RECEIPT : inventory create and send the receipts of all the goods receipt in inventory.
7.invoice creation : supplier sends the invoice to the finance dept of company.

ap_invoice_All
ap_invoice_lines_All


8.Payment : finance dept checks whther the invoices and receipts and if it is okay then make the payment.
ap_bankaccounts_All
ap_bank_branch

9.Payment info transfer to GL : lastly all payment info is sent to the general ledger module (gl)
gl_je_headers
gl_je_lines

Modules affected in P2P Cycle :
1.Inventory module
2.purchasing order (PO) module
3.account payable module(AP)
4.general ledger(GL)

Digram (Notes)  -> Tables
P2P Cycle:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sample Questions:

1.What are the base tables that are affected when you create a P.O?
PO__headers_all
PO__lines_all
PO__distribution_all


2.What is a Purchase Requisition and define various requisitions?
A purchase requisition is an internal document that signifies the intention to acquire goods or services for a business. Here’s how it works:

Employee Request: When an employee or department needs to make a purchase, they fill out a purchase requisition form. This form includes details such as the product description, quantity, estimated price, and the reason for the purchase12.
Review and Approval: The completed purchase requisition is then submitted for review and approval. Reviewers may include the employee’s line manager and the company’s central procurement or purchasing department. This step ensures that purchases align with guidelines and are necessary1.
Purchase Order Creation: Once the purchase requisition is approved, the business issues a purchase order for the requested items. Unlike the requisition, a purchase order is a legally binding contract that outlines exactly what the business intends to buy and for how much money

types of requisition:
1.internal requisition
2.Purchase requsition

3.Purchase Requisition	v/s Purchase Order
Internal request to make a purchase	Confirmation of an order
Created by any employee	Created by the purchasing/procurement group
Created at the start of the procurement process when an employee identifies a need	Created when the business is ready to place an order for goods or services
Contains information such as date of requisition, requisition number, requester’s name and department, products/services requested, and suggested vendor	Includes details like purchase order number, buyer’s name (business), and description of goods and services being purchased




4.Purchase Order types : (4 types)
Standard Purchase Order: You generally create standard purchase orders for a one-time purchase of various items. 
You create standard purchase orders when you know the details of the goods or services you require, 
estimated costs, quantities, delivery schedules, and accounting distributions.

Planned PO: A planned purchase order is a long-term agreement committing to buy items or services from a single source.
EX: Buying goods for Christmas from a specific dealer.

Contract Purchase Orders:
For this type of order, the buyer and seller will have to sign a contract stating the purchase terms and 
conditions before a purchase order regarding the contract is issued.

Blanket PO:
You create blanket purchase agreements when you know the detail of goods or services you plan to buy from a specific supplier in a period, 
but you do not yet know the detail of your delivery schedules. 


5.What is Cursor and its attributes ?
Define Implicit and Explicit Cursors.
A cursor is a pointer that points to a result of a query.
2 types Implicit and Explicit.

implicit vs explicit cursors

Attributes in cursor:
Each cursor has a set of attributes that enables an application program to test the state of the cursor.
These attributes are %ISOPEN, %FOUND, %NOTFOUND, and %ROWCOUNT.


function vs procedure
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-function-and-procedure/

6.How do i submit a concurrent request from PL/SQL?
PL/SQL procedures can submit a request to run a program as a concurrent process by calling FND_REQUEST.SUBMIT_REQUEST


7.How do you “write” to the concurrent request Log and Output file?
fnd_file.put_line(FND_FILE.LOG,'In the log file');
fnd_file.put_line(FND_FILE.OUTPUT,'In the output file');

8.How to break the page in specific condition? 
a. Using word document page break 
b. <?split-by-page-break:?>

9.What are the XML publisher backend tables?
"XDO_DS_DEFINITIONS_B
XDO_DS_DEFINITIONS_TL
XDO_DS_DEFINITIONS_VL
XDO_LOBS
XDO_TEMPLATES_B
XDO_TEMPLATES_TL
XDO_TEMPLATES_VL"

10.oracle reports disadvantages :
oracle reports is in black-white color and in text form but using xml publsiher we can get output in different forms (pdf/charts,graphics,color)

11.How to submit a layout in the backend?  
using API : fnd_request.add_layout

12.What is Data Template and Layout Template?
Data Template is an xml file consisting of data properties,parameter,query,structure and connects the CP to the xml publsiher through shortname
Layout template  : upload the .rtf file , data template in different languages 
data template name  = layout templte codename

13.What are the various sections in the data template? 
Parameters , Dataquery, dataStructure,Triggers,properties


14.How do you migrate layout or data template across instances? 

FNDLOAD and XDOLoader are utilities provided in Oracle Apps to download/upload 
AOL object definition and template (RTF, PDF, and XSL-FO), XML, and XSD files to the XML Publisher database tables.


what is the file supporting the translation for a layout template? 	
XLIFF template(xml based bitext format)
xml - xtensible markup language

15.What triggers are supported in Data template?	
Before Report and After report

16.How to get the second parameter value based on the first parameter
$flex$ value set name.


17.Bind Variables:
Bind variables are part of the database and are used in SQL queries and PL/SQL code.
Placeholders: They act as placeholders for values within the query.
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = :ord;
The :ord is a bind variable. It allows you to supply different values for order_id without requiring a new hard parse for each value.


lookup vs valuesets
triggers vs procedure

Oracle Workflow:
A workflow process consists of a sequence of activities that together make up a business flow, 
expressing your organization’s policies and rules. The activities can include automated functions, 
notifications to users, sub processes and business events.

Examples:
Automatically delivering notifications and reminders of work to be done.
Step through daily transaction flows

Event : An event is an acitvity that takes place inside the system.
Event subcription : list of actions attached to any event is called event subcription.
business event system : an application service to communicate between 2 business events.
desciption:
system -> inbound -> workflow engine ,notification engine -> advanced queuing -> actions attaced then workflow engine -> advance queueing -> outbound -> system.
messages stored and transmitted using oracle net services , http , smtp(simple mail transfer protocol)

oracle workflow builder : a graphical tool to manage workflow process 
define and customize workflow definition
2 parts ( object navigator + process diagram)
icons -> activities , transition -> arrows

item key,itemtype,attribute (txt,number,lookup types)
persistence : it controls how long records should be maintained 

temporary : need to mention number of days 
permanent: indefinite amount of times and to purge it we need to write  a procedure WF_Purge.totalrem()

cost: number of seconds need to execute an activity is called cost in oracle workflow builder.
default value / threshold value -> 1/5000 times of a second 
cost range : 0 - 1lakh second
required cost > default value   -> DEFERRED STATE 

notification mailer : a program used in oracle workflow builder to send remiander and notifications .

access level : it defines whether the user can modify the workflow data.
0 - 9: oracle workflow
10 - 19 : oracle aol
20 - 99 : oracle application development
100 - 999: customer organzisation
1000 :
public


workflow engine :
it is embedded in oracle database .
monitors and execute all the activity from start to the end 
starts with the start activity whether it is function,notification and process.


procedure procedure_name (
itemkey in varchar2,
itemtype in varchar2,
actiid in number,
funcmode in varchar2
result out varchar2
);

to initiate a workflow process :
WF_ENGINE.createprocess and WF_ENGINE.startprocess
OR 
WF_ENGINE.launchprocess

commit/rollback  - AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION

3 VIEWS in directory services :
WF_USERROLES
WF_USERS
WF_ROLES

oracle workfloe builder: integrated in oracle workflow database, uses to transfer process definition bwteen a file and a database.
retry wf : it is used to fix/debug workflow users happend due to server fault.

workflow tables:
wf_events
wf_eventssubcription
wf_notification
wf_messages
wf_items
wf_activities
wf_error
wf_deferred




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-trigger-and-procedure-in-dbms/


valuesets vs lookups 
valuesets -> it can contain duplicate values but lookups didnot contain any duplicate values
valuesets can be used in concurrent program parameters but lookups cant
valusets are maintained by systm administartor , lookups are maintained by users
valuesets are are dynamic but lookups are static 


Independent vs dependent valuests with examples.

independent - > country names
dependent -> city names under each country

Independent value sets are standalone and not linked to any other value set.
Each value in an independent value set is self-contained and doesn’t rely on other values.

Dependent valuesets :
Dependent value sets are linked to another value set, known as the parent value set.

interfaces : data conversion between external systems and oracle appliacitons. ( transfer of data )
types of interfaces - 
1.interbound interface: dtaa transfer from external system to Oracle applications.
2.outerbound interface : data transfer from oracle apps to external system.
3.open interfaces : when oracle apps provide the interface logic it is called open interface 


integration in oracle apps: data and info get transferred bwteeen from one ebs module to another module 
Example : AP to GL, AR to GL

data conversion:
Data conversion in Oracle Apps refers to the process of migrating data 
from legacy or existing systems to a fresh implementation of Oracle Applications.
